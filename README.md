This project was originally just pong and was going to be very quick.

I had never worked on a game in C++ before, even if it's something as simple as pong.

It ended up being finished in three days and I was just going to leave it at that, but I decided I should do something more with it.

That's when I had the idea to do space invaders. I wanted to make a space invaders clone with a menu screen, multi-player, single-player and a high-score system.

Unfortunately it didn't end up that way due to time constraint. I ended up being busy, be it my job or social life.

In the end it ended up not having a menu or finished score system and the graphics are terrible.

But it runs and does what it needs to in the end.

Next time I think it would be better for me to plan ahead and think of exactly what I want to do.

A majority of time spent was considering what I wanted to do with it and how it should be done.

I estimate a total of 6 hours were spent coding and 10 hours were spent staring at the screen between the two games.

Also, I think coffee may be a wise investment. Focus was a pretty big issue.
